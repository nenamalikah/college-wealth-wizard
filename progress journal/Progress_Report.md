- Topics of discussion
    - Creating AWS instance
    - Merging and finalizing data for vector database  
  

- Notes
  - The bureau of labor statistics file is too large to merge with the additional files for the CIP-SOC database
  - An AWS instance is being set up to utilize additional computing power to merge the data sources (and support future computing needs)
  - A connection was also set up between the Pycharm project that contains the capstone files and the AWS instance
  - Began developing question-generation.py to use llamaindex to develop a RAG evaluation set
